In 2012 I proposed using aes(time=variable) to define an animated
ggplot. This package provided the gganim function that takes a ggplot
and makes an animation.

A more recent implementation of this idea is provided by
https://github.com/dgrtwo/gganimate

However, the only interactions possible in gganim/gganimate graphics
are going forward or backward in time. If you want to create a data
visualization which is animated and interactive with respect to other
variables, you should consider using
https://github.com/tdhock/animint.
